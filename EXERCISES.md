# Exercises

You will create a basic chatbox using

- KOA server (provided)
- Frontend framework of your choice (examples provided in React and Angular)
- Library `socket.io`, see https://socket.io/docs/

The sent messages will be stored in the client, meaning all chat history is gone after a reconnect. This also means most of the logic of this application will reside in the frontend. You will use the server mostly for routing calls.

Check out this repo for an example: https://github.com/nathanbreuring/socket-chat

##### 1. Basic functionality

You'll start out small with a chat displaying messages of connected users. You will need:

1. A login screen where a user can pick it's username and proceed to chatbox

After choosing a username, the user enters the chatbox. Here you need:

2. A large, scrollable field displaying the chatHistory
3. An input field for defining user messages
4. A button for sending the user message and a listener on the input field so you can send a message by pressing enter, after which the user message is reset

##### 2. Advanced functionality

Once you got that figured out, you'll add some functionality:

1. Global messages (ie. User X has entered chat)
2. Userpane displaying a list of all currently connected users
3. Private messaging (User X messages User Y)

## Hands on

#### 1. Basics: barebones chatbox

##### Setup

- `cd` in the server directory
- `npm install` and `npm run start:watch`
<!--gek dat je rs moet doen, terwijl je watch aan hebt staan?-->
- the server hotreloads your changes while developing <!--niet echt-->
  &nbsp;
- `cd` in the client directory
- `create-react-app` or NG equivalent to setup your frontend project <!--commando uitbreiden `npx create-react-app chatbox --typescript`-->
<!--ng new chatbox-->
- `npm install` and run `npm start` in two different terminals (ie. on ports 3000 and 3001) <!--cd naar de nieuw gemaakte folder -->
<!--cd naar chatbox, ng serve en daarna ook ng serve --port 4201 -->
- this will start the client twice for testing your chat functionality while developing

##### Guidelines

- In server/server.ts you will find predefined events, each corresponds to the functionality as outlined above
- you will start by implementing the `message` event, for now put in a console.log() so you know you triggered it <!--we zitten  nu in server.ts-->
- Open your freshly generated frontend project and create a generic `.ts` or `.js` file named something like `handlers` in the `src` folder
- `npm install socket.io-client` <!--hiermee beginnen? een stapje omhoog schuiven?-->
<!--moeten we ook de types nog ophalen? npm install @types/socket.io-client-->
<!--voor angular maken we dus een HandlerService, deze is @Injectable met providedIn: 'root' (n wordt in de provider van app module gezet)-->
<!--maak gebruik van ng g service handler-->

- In this file you will create a function which initiates socket.io <!--voor REACT: export function handler = () => {} -->
- `import Socketio from "socket.io-client"`
- `const socket = Socketio.connect("http://localhost:3100")` <!--moet dit ws zijn? niet overal supported-->

- Now that you have the socket.io client at our disposal, you can easily broadcast an event to the server
- `const message = () => { socket.emit("message")}`
<!--REACT: moet ik deze nu ook in een return stoppen onderaan handlers.ts?--->

- Go ahead and instantiate the function in the toplevel component of your project 
<!--nu moet je dus van const App een class maken die PureComponents extend?-->
- Use it to call the function `message()`
  
- You should see the `console.log()` in the terminal as defined earlier in the `server/server.ts` file

- Now it's time to broadcast the message back to all connected clients

- In the `client/src/handlers.ts` you will create a listener function with a callback <!--in de handler-->
- `socket.on("message", function(){})`

- you can use the callback to alter the state of our client, the callback function can be given an parameter to pass the payload from client to server, back to all clients. Make sure you include the parameter in the outgoing event, the server listener and/or the client listener!
<!--dus wel duidelijk dat je binnen de SERVER de console log vervangt door een SOCKET.EMIT>>>>-->

- Basically you now have all the tools to create a basic chatbox as outlined in the functionality above
- I'll leave it to you to figure out how to connect it to your frontend
  &nbsp;
  A few tips:
- To keep things simple, make an empty list called `chatHistory` to which you can push an object containg the userMessage and the userName.

- You can use `chatHistory` to map out entries and display all sent lines, you can use the socket.io listener event in the `handlers` file to add entries

- Hook up your outgoing `message` event to an <input> and a <button>Button</button> component
  &nbsp;
  Remember:
- socket's `.on()` function is a listener 
- socket's `.emit()` function is an outgoing event or `broadcasting`

#### 2. Advanced functionality

In the basic exercise the message was broadcasted to all connected clients. You will build some features now which require you to broadcast to specific clients. To do so, we need to keep track of which clients are connected.

##### Guidelines

###### Keeping state in the backend

- In `server/server.ts` you will need to keep state of which clients connected to the server
- Create an array of objects, each containing a userName and clientId

- When a user has entered their username, you will emit an `enter` event with socket.io from the client

- In `server/server.ts` we are listening to this event in the predefined function `enter`
- You will use this event to map the username - specified in the frontend, to a clientId - specified in the backend by creating a listener in the server
  &nbsp;
- The `username` will be accessible by using a parameter in the `enter` event - sent from the frontend since it is user-defined
- The `clientId` can be retrieved by calling `client.id` inside the `io.on(client) { }` function in `server/server.ts`
<!--deze regel snap ik niet helemaal? er is geen io.on(client)-->
  &nbsp;
- Create 2 helper functions for adding and removing clients to the array
- Hookup the `enter` event to your frontend flow by calling `emit` when you see fit
  &nbsp;
- Whenever a client refreshes/closes the browser, socket.io will automatically emit a `disconnect` event. Use this hook to remove the client from the `connectedClients`

###### Keeping state in the frontend

- In the frontend you don't have a `clientId` at your disposal
- We will create a listener to retrieve this clientId from the server, once it is done processing
- In `server/server.ts` add an `emit` event with type `updateUser` to the `enter` listener
- It's really important you send this event ONLY to the client who is now entering the chatbox
- You can use this event, to update a `user` object in your frontend, in which you map clientId to userName
- You will have to create a listener in your frontend. You can use this hook to alter the state in your frontend
  &nbsp;
- You can send a event to a specific user by calling `.to( )` like:
  `io.to(clientId).emit(key, payload)`
- In this case the key will be `updateUser` and the payload will be `{id, userName}`

###### Displaying global messages

Displaying a message about users entering/leaving the chat should be easy by now. Use your creativity and define events to track this, use listeners in the frontend to update the state.

###### Displaying connected users

The steps described in `keeping state in the ...` should make this functionality relatively quick to implement.

- The server keeps track of all connected clients
- Whenever this list is updated, you will `emit` a message to all connected clients.
- In the frontend you `listen` to this event and update state accordingly
  &nbsp;
- In this case, keeping a copy of the list in your frontend is advisable
- Though be sure to let the backend handle the updating (removing/adding) of this list, so you never have 2 different versions of `connectedClients`
  &nbsp;
- Create a section displaying all connected users
- In preparation of creating private chat functionality, make sure each displayed userName is wrapped inside a button

###### Creating private chat functionality

By now you have all the components at your disposal to implement this feature.

- Because you keep a list of connectedClients you can easily emit a `privateMessage` event, ONLY to the involved users (sender, receiver)
- The sender will be the `user` you kept in state. The recipient `selectedUser` will be who ever the sender clicks in the section displaying all connected users.
- You can emit to multiple clients by calling `io.to(user.id).to(selectedUser.id).emit(key, payload)`
- Once the `selectedUser` is clicked, you update state and open a private chatbox section
- To keep track of multiple privateChats between different connectedClients, I suggest keeping a list of objects. Each object containing a `userPair` containing information about `user1` and `user2`. In this object also keep track of their `chatHistory`. This would be another list with objects, similar to the one you coded earlier while builing the `barebones chatbox`
  &nbsp;
- You will need to implement logic for pushing a new item to the `privateChats` list when initiating a chat.
- You will need to implement logic for finding an existing `privateChat` between a `userPair`, and pushing a new message to their `chatHistory`
